## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

Plateful Palette is built using a robust tech stack that ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. Here‚Äôs how it all works:

### üîß Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.
  
- **Backend**: Powered by Django, providing the logic for handling requests, managing user sessions, and interfacing with the database.
  
- **Database**: SQLite3 stores user data, recipes, and nutritional information efficiently.
  
- **APIs**: Integrated with external services like Wikibook and Nutritionix to fetch the latest recipes and nutritional data.
  
- **Hosting**: Deployed on AWS with NGINX to ensure high availability and scalability.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Django‚Äôs built-in authentication system handles user registration, login, and profile management.

2. **Ingredient Input & Recipe Suggestion**: Users input ingredients, which the backend processes to find matching recipes in the database. If no matches are found, the app queries external APIs to fetch new recipes.

3. **Nutritional Information**: For each recipe, the app pulls detailed nutritional data from the Nutritionix API and displays it to the user.

### üß© System Architecture

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
  
- **Backend**: Django handles the server-side logic, managing requests and interfacing with the database to serve up the right recipes and nutritional data.
  
- **Database**: SQLite3 is used for storing user data, recipes, and nutritional information. It's lightweight yet powerful enough for the needs of the app.
  
- **APIs**: Integration with Wikibook and Nutritionix APIs enriches the app with up-to-date recipes and nutritional data.
  
- **Hosting**: AWS with NGINX is used to host the app, ensuring it's fast, reliable, and can handle a large number of users.
